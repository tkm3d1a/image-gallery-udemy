# Full Stack Practice

## About

This is my documentation as I follow a Udemy Tutorial on building a full stack web application. I use Documentation here pretty loosely as I may or may not add anything more offical as I get farther along.  currently it will be mostly just a sor tof snip of notes as I continue on building.

The intent behind this is not to build some MVP to show off, but I am attempting to document my learning process a bit better, and show how I progress as I go farther along.

Once a "stage" is complete, I don't intend to go back and refactor anything, but may stylistcly update as I get further along.  My end goal is to be able to deploy this fully hosted using something like GCP or Azure.  That will be another event in and of it self though, so for now, I live on localhost...

## Stage 1 (React)

Stage 1 complete:
- built front end app
- utilizes Unsplash api
- no current db or backend
- no security for key (cannot build/deploy publicly until secured)
- built using react-bootstrap
- practice with react components
- all current code contained in [FrontEnd](./frontend/) folder

## Stage 2 (Python/flask API)

## Stage 3 (DB integration?)

## Stage 4 (Dockerizing?)
